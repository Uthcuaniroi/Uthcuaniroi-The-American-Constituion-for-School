    <header class="header">Does religous text in our currency and Pledge of Allegiance violate our First Amendment rights (Freedom of Speach)? Well, let's find out.</header>
    <br class="br">
    <header class="header">First of all, what exactly am I talking about?</header>
    <br class="br">
    <p class="text">To start off, let's give ourselves a reminder of what the First Amendment is. It states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."-<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/#:~:text=Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States,-First%20Amendment&text=Congress%20shall%20make%20no%20law,for%20a%20redress%20of%20grievances." class="text">Congress.gov</a> Specfically, we're looking at the part that reads "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion..." It clearly states that it will not pass any law respecting the establishment of religion, and yet, saying the Pledge of Allegiance is law. So is that considered an establishment of religion? My answer, yes. While the law to say the Pledge of Allegiance isn't enforced, it still violates the First Amendment, even though it isn't doing so directly. And imprinted on our coins and dollar bills is "IN GOD WE TRUST". And the US currency without "IN GOD WE TRUST" is considered fake money. So that also violates the First Amendment.</p>
    <header class="header">So what should we do about it?</header>
    <br class="br">
    <p class="text">Honestly, it depends on whether or not you actually care. That's the thing. If you're enemies with the US, then you could bring this up. But if you just don't want to say the Pledge of Allegiance, go ahead. Don't say it. It's not like the cops will come and chase you down, just to make you say the Pledge of Allegiance. And, well, money is money. All you have to do is ignore the "IN GOD WE TRUST" part. So really, it's just a question of: "Do you care?"</p>
