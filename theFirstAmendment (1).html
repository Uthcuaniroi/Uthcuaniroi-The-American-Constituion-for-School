      <p class="text">The First Amendment is the Freedom of Speach. It states that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."-<a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-1/#:~:text=Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States,-First%20Amendment&text=Congress%20shall%20make%20no%20law,for%20a%20redress%20of%20grievances." class="text">Congress.gov</a></p>

      <a class="text">In the Tinker Case of 1969, the Tinker family and others were peacefully protesting against the war in Vietnam by wearing black armbands. However, when the school found out, they banned black armbands, punishable by suspension. Despite this, the Tinker family wore the armbans anyways. However, before the day was even over, they were suspended for having "interfered with the education of our children". The Tinker Family decided to bring this to court.</a>

      <a class="text">It was eventually decided that the Tinker family was protected by the 1st amendment, as they had only been peacefully protesting. They had not disrupted class, made any trouble, or “interfered with the education of our children”, contrary to the school's claims. It was decided that what the school was doing was unconstitutional.</a>
