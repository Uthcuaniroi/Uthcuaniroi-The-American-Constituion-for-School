      <a class="text">In the Goss v. Lopez case of 1974, Dwight Lopez and Betty Crome were 2 of 9 students (across 3 schools) suspended by their schools for 10 days, without being given a proper hearing, as Ohio law did not require the schools to do so. Some of the parents took the principals' action to court, and after a federal court found that the students' right had been violated, the case was brought to the Supreme Court.</a>
