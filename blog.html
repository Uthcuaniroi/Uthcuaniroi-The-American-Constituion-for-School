    <header class="header">What would life be like in the US without our First Amendment rights?</header>
    <br class="br">
    <p class="text">Well, since the First Amendment is the right of freedom of religion, speech, press, assembly, and petition, not having those rights means a life where we can't do any of those things. It would be a life where maybe you're forced to practice a certain religion, maybe a certain religion is banned, etc. Stuff like Youtube or News Channels probably wouldn't exist, because you wouldn't be given the freedom of speech or press. You couldn't even protest, because that was protected by your First Amendment Rights, which you no longer have.</p>
    <br class="br">
    <p class="text">Basically, if for some reason you've lost your First Amendment rights despite being a US citizen and being in the US, and then the government decides to abuse that fact, well, life will probably become horrible for you.  But, that's a lot of "if"s, which is a reason why it's not really something you should generally be worried about.</p>
